# Flutter Setup Scripts

This repository contains **automated setup scripts** for installing and configuring Flutter and the Android SDK on **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)** and **Windows (PowerShell)**.  
They handle dependencies, environment variables, SDK downloads, emulator creation, and Flutter configuration.

---

## üìÇ Scripts

- **Linux (Bash):** `setup-flutter.sh`
- **Windows (PowerShell):** `setup-flutter.ps1`

---

## üöÄ Features

- Installs and updates **Flutter SDK** (`stable` branch).
- Installs and configures **Android SDK + command-line tools**.
- Ensures **JDK 17** is available and set as default.
- Adds required **PATH environment variables** automatically.
- Accepts Android SDK licenses.
- Installs:
  - Platform tools, build-tools, emulator
  - API levels **34** and **36** (including system images with Google APIs)
  - **NDK 27.0.12077973**
- Creates ready-to-use **Android emulators**:
  - `Pixel_API_36` (Linux)
  - `Pixel_API_34` (Linux)
  - `Pixel_5_API_36` (Windows)
  - `Pixel_5_API_34` (Windows)
- Runs `flutter doctor` and `flutter precache` to prepare SDKs (Android, Web, Desktop).

## üìã Requirements

### Linux

- Ubuntu/Debian-based distro
- `sudo` privileges
- Internet connection

The script installs required packages automatically:

- `git`, `curl`, `unzip`, `wget`, `build-essential`, `openjdk-17-jdk`, `chromium`, and more.

### Windows

- PowerShell 5+ (recommended: PowerShell 7+)
- Git installed and available in `PATH`
- JDK 17 installed (e.g., Eclipse Adoptium)
- Google Chrome installed

---

## ‚ö° Usage

### Linux

```bash
chmod +x setup-flutter.sh
./setup-flutter.sh
````

After completion:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Windows

Run in **PowerShell (as user)**:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\setup-flutter.ps1
```

Then restart PowerShell to load updated environment variables.

---

## üß™ Verification

After running the script, you can verify the setup with:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

Expected: no major issues reported.

To list created emulators:

```bash
flutter emulators
```

To start one:

```bash
flutter emulators --launch Pixel_API_36
```

(Windows: replace with `Pixel_5_API_36`)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- The script **resets Flutter SDK** to the latest `stable` branch.
- Existing AVDs with the same names are skipped (not overwritten).
- On Linux, if Chromium is not installed, it will be added automatically.
- On Windows, if Chrome or JDK 17 are missing, the script **aborts**.

---

## üì± Ready-to-Use Emulators

- Pixel API 36 (Android 14+)
- Pixel API 34 (Android 14)

Both come with:

- Google APIs
- Hardware keyboard enabled by default

---

‚úÖ After running these scripts, your system will be ready for **Flutter app development on Android, Web, and Desktop**.
